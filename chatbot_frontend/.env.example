# When running behind a preview/proxy domain, CRA's dev server may reject
# requests with "Invalid Host header". Set the following to allow the host.

# Host and port the dev server should bind to.
# 0.0.0.0 allows external access through the preview proxy.
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=3000

# IMPORTANT: Disable host check to accept forwarded Host headers from the preview system.
# This is safe in controlled CI/preview environments but should not be used on the open internet.

# If your backend API is on a different origin in development, set this to bypass the CRA proxy.
# Otherwise leave it unset and rely on "proxy" in package.json for /api/*.
